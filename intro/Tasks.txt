5.shapeArea
Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.



Example

For n = 2, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 13.

6. makeArrayConsecutive2
Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.

Example

For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.

Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.
*******************************************************
7. almostIncreasingSequence
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false.

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
**********************************************************
8. matrixElementsSum
After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the CodeBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).

Example

For

matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2], 
          [0, 5, 0, 0], 
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]

sortByHeight(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].
********************************************************************
13. reverseInParentheses
Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.

Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.

Example

For inputString = "(bar)", the output should be
reverseInParentheses(inputString) = "rab";
For inputString = "foo(bar)baz", the output should be
reverseInParentheses(inputString) = "foorabbaz";

14. alternatingSums
Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.

You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.

Example

For a = [50, 60, 60, 45, 70], the output should be
alternatingSums(a) = [180, 105].
***********************************************************************
15. addBorder
Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.

Example

                      "*****"]
********************************************************************
16. areSimilar
Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

For a = [1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = false.

Any swap of any two elements either in a or in b won't make a and b equal.
************************************************************************************
17. arrayChange
You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

We can rearrange "aabb" to make "abba", which is a palindrome.
******************************************************************************
19. areEquallyStrong
Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.

Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.

Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong.

Example

For yourLeft = 10, yourRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 9, the output should be
areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = false.
*************************************************************************
20. arrayMaximalAdjacentDifference
Given an array of integers, find the maximal absolute difference between any two of its adjacent elements.

Example

******************************************************************************
21. isIPv4Address 
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.

Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

Example

For inputString = "172.16.254.1", the output should be
isIPv4Address(inputString) = true;

For inputString = "172.316.254.1", the output should be
isIPv4Address(inputString) = false.

316 is not in range [0, 255].

For inputString = ".254.255.0", the output should be
isIPv4Address(inputString) = false.

There is no first number.
*********************************************************************************
22. avoidObstacles
You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.

Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.

Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

Example

For inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9], the output should be
avoidObstacles(inputArray) = 4.

********************************************************************************
23. boxBlur
Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral! You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.

The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 × 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.

Example

For

image = [[1, 1, 1], 
         [1, 7, 1], 
         [1, 1, 1]]
the output should be boxBlur(image) = [[1]].

To get the value of the middle pixel in the input 3 × 3 square: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 15 / 9 = 1.66666 = 1. The border pixels are cropped from the final result.

For

image = [[7, 4, 0, 1], 
         [5, 6, 2, 2], 
         [6, 10, 7, 8], 
         [1, 4, 2, 0]]
the output should be

boxBlur(image) = [[5, 4], 
                  [4, 4]]
There are four 3 × 3 squares in the input image, so there should be four integers in the blurred output. To get the first value: (7 + 4 + 0 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 10 + 7) = 47 / 9 = 5.2222 = 5. The other three integers are obtained the same way, then the surrounding integers are cropped from the final result.

24. minesweeper
In the popular Minesweeper game you have a board with some mines and those cells that don't contain a mine have a number in it that indicates the total number of mines in the neighboring cells. Starting off with some arrangement of mines we want to create a Minesweeper game setup.

Example

For

matrix = [[true, false, false],
          [false, true, false],
          [false, false, false]]
the output should be

minesweeper(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
                       [2, 1, 1],
                       [1, 1, 1]]

Example

For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.
*************************************************************************
31. depositProfit
You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold.

Example

For deposit = 100, rate = 20, and threshold = 170, the output should be
depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

Each year the amount of money in your account increases by 20%. So throughout the years, your balance would be:

year 0: 100;
year 1: 120;
year 2: 144;
year 3: 172.8.
Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, so the answer is 3.
**************************************************************************************
32. absoluteValuesSumMinimization
Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
(where abs denotes the absolute value)

If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

Example

For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a) = 4.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(4 - 2) + abs(7 - 2) = 7.
for x = 4, the value will be abs(2 - 4) + abs(4 - 4) + abs(7 - 4) = 5.
for x = 7, the value will be abs(2 - 7) + abs(4 - 7) + abs(7 - 7) = 8.
The lowest possible value is when x = 4, so the answer is 4.

For a = [2, 3], the output should be absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a) = 2.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(3 - 2) = 1.
for x = 3, the value will be abs(2 - 3) + abs(3 - 3) = 1.
Because there is a tie, the smallest x between x = 2 and x = 3 is the answer.

Example

For inputArray = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6] and k = 2, the output should be
arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inputArray, k) = 8.
All possible sums of 2 consecutive elements are:

2 + 3 = 5;
3 + 5 = 8;
5 + 1 = 6;
1 + 6 = 7.
Thus, the answer is 8.
**********************************************************************************
38. growingPlant
Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently. Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed. But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.

Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially. Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

Example

For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.
************************************************************************************
39. knapsackLight
You found two items in a treasure chest! The first item weighs weight1 and is worth value1, and the second item weighs weight2 and is worth value2. What is the total maximum value of the items you can take with you, assuming that your max weight capacity is maxW and you can't come back for the items later?

Note that there are only two items and you can't bring more than one item of each type, i.e. you can't take two first items or two second items.

Example

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 8, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 10.

You can only carry the first item.

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 9, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 16.

You're strong enough to take both of the items with you.

For value1 = 5, weight1 = 3, value2 = 7, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 6, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 7.

You can't take both items, but you can take any of them.

digitDegree(n) = 0;
For n = 100, the output should be
digitDegree(n) = 1.
1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
For n = 91, the output should be

The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement. Check out the example below to see how it can move:


Example

For bishop = "a1" and pawn = "c3", the output should be
bishopAndPawn(bishop, pawn) = true.
*****************************************************************************
43. isBeautifulString
A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc.

Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.

Example

For inputString = "bbbaacdafe", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = true.

This string contains 3 as, 3 bs, 1 c, 1 d, 1 e, and 1 f (and 0 of every other letter), so since there aren't any letters that appear more frequently than the previous letter, this string qualifies as beautiful.

For inputString = "aabbb", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = false.

Since there are more bs than as, this string is not beautiful.

For inputString = "bbc", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = false.

Although there are more bs than cs, this string is not beautiful because there are no as, so therefore there are more bs than as.
*********************************************************************************
44. findEmailDomain
An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"), an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").

The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however, also allows a lot of different special characters. Here you can look at several examples of correct and incorrect email addresses.

Given a valid email address, find its domain part.

Example

For address = "prettyandsimple@example.com", the output should be
findEmailDomain(address) = "example.com";
For address = "fully-qualified-domain@codesignal.com", the output should be
findEmailDomain(address) = "codesignal.com".

*************************************************************************************
46. electionsWinners
Given an array of the numbers of votes given to each of the candidates so far, and an integer k equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election.

The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all.

Example

For votes = [2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 3, the output should be
electionsWinners(votes, k) = 2.

The first candidate got 2 votes. Even if all of the remaining 3 candidates vote for him, he will still have only 5 votes, i.e. the same number as the third candidate, so there will be no winner.
The second candidate can win if all the remaining candidates vote for him (3 + 3 = 6 > 5).
The third candidate can win even if none of the remaining candidates vote for him. For example, if each of the remaining voters cast their votes for each of his opponents, he will still be the winner (the votes array will thus be [3, 4, 5, 3]).
The last candidate can't win no matter what (for the same reason as the first candidate).
Thus, only 2 candidates can win (the second and the third), which is the answer.

47. isMAC48Address
A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.

The standard (IEEE 802) format for printing MAC-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups of two hexadecimal digits (0 to 9 or A to F), separated by hyphens (e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-AB).

Your task is to check by given string inputString whether it corresponds to MAC-48 address or not.

Example

For inputString = "00-1B-63-84-45-E6", the output should be
isMAC48Address(inputString) = true;
For inputString = "Z1-1B-63-84-45-E6", the output should be

49. lineEncoding
Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.
Example

For s = "aabbbc", the output should be
lineEncoding(s) = "2a3bc".
